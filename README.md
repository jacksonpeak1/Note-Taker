## Description

For this assignment we were required to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. I enjoyed this activity very much. One of the most essential aspects of this project was working with and requiring in the third party package express, which is a library of different functions that helped me create a server. Much of the specific coding functions and methods came from the express documentation, which is required to ensure that express works correctly. Then on the server we needed to add different routes, these were teh apiRoutes and htmlRoutes files. Additionally i installed and utilized uuid as a unique identity creator, and wrote a function based on uuid's documentation that generated random ids. Additionally i utilized util to make sure that all of the functions in the code were returned as promises. Overall I enjoyed this assignment very much and I look forward to working with mysql and the future units.
